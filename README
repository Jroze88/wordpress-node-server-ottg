Web scraper for use with OTTG's WordPress site. 
Run from the wordpress's own Apache server, 
all contributors will have their latest articles, titles, images, etc scraped
and re-constructed into a WordPress posting.

WordPress API sucks.

WordPress API constructs article + title, seperate post for image, 
image is downloaded by scraper, some contributors get a custom image, Title is parsed, text is added to generic thumbnail and
headline image is created for each post dynamically
binds image post as headline to the existing text post in a net of promises (thanks wordpress)

Youtube Videos insert no body into the article but a span with a CLASS containing the URL of that video. 
WordPress client-side script in the header redirects any article wherein that CLASS is found to the URL that is it's ID
--- This way visitors are reourted to the channel itself and YouTube Contributors still get traffic to see all their other
videos, posts, etc
